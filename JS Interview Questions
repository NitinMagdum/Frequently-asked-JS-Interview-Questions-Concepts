#JavaScript Interview Questions/Concepts

######Do setTimeOut and setInterval always call the function associated with them?
When calling setTimeout or setInterval, a timer thread in the browser starts counting down and when time up puts the callback function in JavaScript thread's execution stack.
The callback function is not executed before other functions above it in the stack finishes. So if there are other time-consuming functions being executed when time up, the callback of setTimeout will not finish in time.
